Abstractions:
- FileProcessor
- Maze (ADT) (string[][] --> should not represent a maze) dont do this. Use public interface that the maze provide, put it in some type of class to encapsulate some data ??
- Position
- Direction/Compass (ENUM N='north') we can use enum everywhere we want, change it once 
- MazeSolver

Java implementation:
- FileProcessor (instead of -, what if they wanted to use a number sign) (interface)
- MazeSolver (multiple different algorithms) (interface)

Mention every example, write every abstraction down and justify they exist

abstract class implements
static methods (main) dont use them
main class --> should be simple
Low coupling --> pass in the objects as parameters
class 1 and class 2
class 1 creates objects of class 2 inside of the class 1 ??
class 2 objects as parameter to class 1
change the implementation outside the class pass in objects into the class
